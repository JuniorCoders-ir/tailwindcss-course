          Well I can't say we were really planning on it but over the last few
          weeks we've been having a ton of fun dumping new and exciting features
          into
          <a
            class="text-gray-500 underline lowercase"
            href="https://tailwindcss.com"
          >
            Tailwind
          </a>
          and now feels like the right time to cut a release, so hereit is â€”
          Tailwind CSS v2.2!
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that although this is a minor release and there
          are no breaking changes in the classic engine,
          <strong class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
            Just-in-Time mode is still in preview and v2.2 introduces a few very
            small changes that might impact you,
          </strong>
          so make sure you read through the changes and deprecations in the
          release notes when upgrading.
